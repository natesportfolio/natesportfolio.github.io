        The point of this project was to educate us about logarithms, and my teacher chose to present it in an entertaining way. We were to find the likelihoods of dying from any given cause, and put them through a logarithm to output a graph that anybody could read and understand. The point of the logarithm was to shrink the values to make a more readable graph. Rather than use the "causes of dying" prompt, I decided to go for the maximum amount of RAM that the average user could have in their computer, beginning in 1970 and incrementing in 5-year steps until 2015. The original assignment was called "Death by Log", and in keeping with tradition, I named mine "Death by Maximum Amount of RAM". For this project, I received an 8 out of 8 on the IB grading scale, which translates roughly to an A++.
