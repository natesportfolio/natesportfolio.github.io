        Our math teacher tasked us with finding out some statistic about our fellow classmates. Some of my peers chose to do statistics such as the total distance (in meters) that our computer mouse moved over a period of time, but I chose to study how productive people were with their uses of the Internet. For this project, I received an 8 out of 8 in the four categories in which it was graded, which roughly translates to four A++'s.

    That presentation was created using Google Slides, and I used it in a presentation for my Math class.
