            I recently started a YouTube channel known as Tekteen, that focuses on the hardware of desktop computers, including building computers, benchmarking components and "modding" (short for modifying) by painting and shaping them. In an effort to receive review samples of products, I've begun correspondence with a number of companies to attempt to discern what their guidelines are for YouTubers.

I've got another video entirely recorded and edited, waiting to be uploaded. I've completed the script for another video, and the benchmarking for a different one. I've also got plans for 3 additional videos. You can view my completed video there.

            Much of my correspondence has been recieved positively. Here's an example:

            Hey guys, how’s it going? Today, we’re going to be taking a look at this Tree New Bee 15.6-Inch Laptop Cooling Pad. Let’s get started. *roll intro*
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ll begin with a quick tour of the outside. Just looking at it, the pad looks pretty nice. There’s all kinds of gamer-y angles all over the place, as well as a large badge in the middle with the logo on it. I wish they could have made it flush with the mesh on the top, but it doesn’t really interfere with putting the laptop on it or anything, so I won’t complain. It’s got some blue LEDs on the fans that are pretty hard to see once you put the laptop on top, but they provide a bit of an underglow, which isn’t too bad. The top of the plastic case has a textured surface on it, which I assume serves to grip the laptop. There’s a pair of legs on the bottom of the back that fold out to angle the pad, and there’s another pair on the top of the front that fold out to angle the laptop. I usually like to fold the back legs to provide a bit of an angled feel, which works reasonably well despite the flat keyboard that my laptop has. On the back of the pad, there’s a dual USB 3 port hub. One of those ports always has to be plugged into your computer in order to power it, but you could technically use the second port to daisy-chain as many cooling pads as you’d like. I’m sure someone somewhere has two cooling pads on top of each other. There’s two fan speed controllers there as well, supposedly one is for the back two fans and one for the front two, but quite frankly, they don’t do a very good job of controlling anything and work just about as well as two on-off switches. If you turn them all the way back, there’s a place where they click, but even if you go all the way except for the click the fans still turn off, so I’m not quite sure why they added that click. Anyway, to benchmarks! Note that all stress tests were conducted over a 20-minute period.

            Without the pad, my laptop’s CPU idles at <b>x</b> degrees Celsius. When I put an AIDA 64 stress test on the CPU, FPU and cache, it reaches <b>x</b> degrees.

            With the pad not running, the laptop on it, and the legs in various positions, the CPU idles at <b>x</b> degrees, and reaches <b>x</b> degrees under load.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the pad running, the laptop on it, and the legs in various positions, our idle temp is <b>x</b> degrees and the load temp is <b>x</b> degrees.
