    The book was created for children between 1<sup>st</sup> grade and 5<sup>th</sup> grade, and is fashioned after traditional books meant to teach young children the alphabet. However, our book has a twist. It explains complex and advanced space terminology (such as apoapsis and Delta V) with simple words. I collaborated on the project with one of my best friends, Sta&#347;.

  The graphics were all created using Photoshop, and employed a bit of a whimsical and creative license. The final project was put together using Google Slides.
