        As part of a mock-Shark Tank project for my IB Design class, I designed a product called the Mobi, a reference to Moby Dick. It was meant to be a case for your phone that could essentially turn it into a tablet. I made a website for it, and I 3D-printed
        a prototype. The project was created with another classmate called Jonathan. On the IB grading scale, it received three 7 out of 8's, which roughly translates to three A's.
