        This animation was created a few months before the Supreme Court ruling of June, 2015 that same-sex marriage was constitutional, and was for an open-ended project about civil rights where we had to choose a group with threatened rights, and make some sort of presentation on their struggle to obtain their rights.

        The animation was created using a SAM Animation kit (now Hue Animation) and is stop-motion. Every single picture was hand-drawn by me. To achieve the effect where it seemed as if the animation were drawing itself, I would draw a small portion of the drawing and then take a picture, and essentially repeat until I was done with that section.
