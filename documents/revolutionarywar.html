    <h1>Revolutionary War Weaponry</h1>
    <p class="c1 c3"><span></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Revolutionary War, weaponry was very important. While both sides had many skilled troops, the weapons were crude and primitive. An example of such a weapon was the bayonet. Early bayonets were short spears or knives that were attached to the barrel of the gun via a plug. They were invented in 1640, and were named after their city of origin, Bayonne, France. </span></p>
    <p
        class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Revolutionary War, muskets were known as the &ldquo;spear that could shoot&rdquo;, due to it being able to stab and shoot. They were used primarily for melee. During melee, they were used primarily for thrusting and jabbing. Soldiers charged with the bayonets after shooting a couple of volleys. The bayonets had sharp points, and were brutally effective. They caused many of the wounds and deaths during the Revolutionary War.</span></p>
        <p
            class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Revolutionary War-era musket had a barrel without grooves, which meant faster bullets that were less accurate. The muskets were accurate up to 100 yards, however, accuracy was of very limited importance because most of the battles were short distance skirmishes. The opposing regiments would line up face-to-face and fire two to three volleys, which were essentially when everyone fired their gun at the same time. Due to the low accuracy of the muskets, the soldiers filled the air with bullets in order to have a higher chance of hitting someone. After the volleys, the soldiers would charge with their bayonets.</span></p>
            <p
                class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The musket was long, and fired from the shoulder. When the trigger was pulled, some flint inside the barrel struck steel, which created a spark that ignited the gunpowder, which propelled the bullet. This was why they were called flintlock muskets. When it was raining or there was inclement weather, the muskets did not fire due to the gunpowder being damp. </span></p>
                <p
                    class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed was very important, in order to fill the air with as many bullets as possible. A trained soldier could fire a musket four times per minute, which may seem slow nowadays but was very fast back then.</span></p>
                    <p
                        class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, the Patriots had to bring weapons from home. Due to this, there was a shortage. This led the Continental Congress to order guns from American and European gunsmiths, but this created a problem because not every business accepted the currency used back then, and the Continental Congress printed so much of the currency that it eventually became worth nothing.</span></p>
                        <p
                            class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &ldquo;Brown Bess&rdquo; was a British musket that was used whenever it could be captured from the British. It fired a one-ounce lead ball.</span></p>
                            <p class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1778, France became an ally of the Patriots. France sent shipments of french muskets, which were favored by the Patriots. French muskets were lighter than the &ldquo;Brown Bess&rdquo; and fired a smaller lead ball.</span></p>
                            <p
                                class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the Revolutionary War, due to the deadly accuracy of their rifles, American riflemen were feared by the British to the point that British officers were advised to remove gold trimmings from their coats in order to present less of a target. However, once a rifleman had fired he could easily be overtaken by a dragoon or by men with bayonets.</span></p>
                                <p
                                    class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rifles were long, and were powerful weapons in the hands of Patriot scouts. It was more accurate than a musket by a long shot, due to the grooves in the barrel. The grooves caused the bullet to spin, which allowed it to travel much farther in a straight line. The rifle was accurate up to 300 yards.</span></p>
                                    <p
                                        class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artillery was very important during the Revolutionary War. However, it took a long time to reload, because the barrel had to be swabbed after every shot.</span></p>
                                        <p
                                            class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Field cannons were lightweight, mobile and fired solid shot on a flat trajectory. This allowed it to create large holes in the enemy infantry. Heavy siege cannons had limited mobility, and also fired solid shot. They were used chiefly for destroying forts, buildings and ships. Against ships, the siege cannons used hot shot, which was a superheated cannonball that set fire to the ships. The siege cannons also used bar shots and chain shots, which were halves of a cannonball attached by a bar or a chain. Bar shots and chain shots could be used for taking down the masts and rigging of ships.</span></p>
                                            <p
                                                class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mortar was a flat bed of wood. An elevated wedge raised the barrel so that it could shoot at a high trajectory. The mortar shot an exploding shell, or a &ldquo;bomb&rdquo;, so that it would fly over the enemy earthworks. When properly fired, the bomb would explode in the air and rain shrapnel on the enemy. The mortar could fire effectively up to 750 yards.</span></p>
                                                <p
                                                    class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A howitzer was a cannon and a mortar combined. It could fire on a flat or high trajectory, was mounted on wheels for higher mobility, and could fire bombs and cannon balls. It was effective up to 750 yards.</span></p>
                                                    <p
                                                        class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of many hand-held items, such as pistols and swords, was a very widespread thing. Many of them were given to officers and sergeants as a sign of rank. Officers were given small swords, and dragoons were given pistols and sabers. Despite this, pistols were considered rare.</span></p>
                                                        <p
                                                            class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pistols were mostly given to cavalrymen and officers. They were effective at close range, were operated and held by one hand and the barrel was six inches long. Pistols were difficult to operate, because of the extensive load times. They were non-repeating, which meant one shot per cock of the gun.</span></p>
                                                            <p
                                                                class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pole-arms were close-combat weapons that consisted of pikes, spears, halberds, partisans and spontoons. They were used mainly for cutting or thrusting, and were made up of a blade at the end of a long wooden shaft. The long wooden shaft would extend the effective range.</span></p>
                                                                <p

The cutlass was used by infantrymen, and was a short, broad slashing sword. It had a straight or slightly curved blade and was sharpened on the cutting edge. </span></p>
                                                                    <p
                                                                        class="c1"><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sabre was a heavy cavalry sword, but a smaller variation was given to officers. It had a curved blade and a single cutting edge. Small sabres were light, straight and slender and were often used for directing troops.</span></p>
                                                                        <p

While they were crude and primitive, they were brutally effective and very good at what they did.</span></p>
