        This project involved the creation of astrolabes, devices used to measure the angle between you and the top of an object in order to calculate its height, from materials found around the classroom. We were then supposed to go outside and measure some nearby buildings, do the calculations and then compare our results with the results of a Google search and reflect upon our accuracy. For this assignment, I received 8 out of 8's in the two categories that it was graded in, which roughly translates to two A++'s.

    <h1>Astrolabe</h1>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">Nate</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c13 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1 c8">Objective:</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To use everyday materials to construct an astrolabe, in order to approximate the heights of certain structures using the Tan principle of trigonometry.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c1 c8">Background:</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c11"><span class="c1">The astrolabe is an ancient machine that was used for calculations relating to the time and the sun, and for navigational purposes using the stars for plotting positions and courses. They can also be used for plotting the heights and relative distances of objects, provided you know one or the other.</span></p>
    <p
        class="c3 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1 c8">Procedure:</span></p>
        <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to make a rudimentary astrolabe, you must print a template for one online. It would look like half of a protractor, and would have all of the angles marked. You must then cut out the template using scissors.</span></p>
        <p
            class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should attach the cut-out template to a cardboard backing in order to ensure that the paper does not flop around and present a challenge when measuring the angle. You must then create a hole in the top-right of the template.</span></p>
            <p
                class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut a length of string and tie a weight to one end. Put the string through the hole, and tie knots in the open end until it won&rsquo;t go through the hole.</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attach a straw to the top edge of the astrolabe and you are done.</span></p>
                <p class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to utilize this astrolabe, you must walk outside and find a building to measure. A tall building would work better than a short one. Look through the straw at the top of the building and have someone read out the angle that the string is at. If you would like to calculate the height of the building, you need to know how far away it is and how high your eyes are. If you would like to calculate the relative distance of the building, you need to know how tall it is.</span></p>
                <p
                    class="c3 c13"><span class="c1"></span></p>
                    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The math involved is the Tan principle, which is:</span></p>

                    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">o = The opposite of the triangle, which in this case is the height of the building</span></p>
                    <p class="c3"><span class="c1">a = The adjacent of the triangle, which in this case is your distance from the building</span></p>

                        <p class="c3 c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Goldman Sachs Building is actually 238 meters tall, versus the 167.68 meters that was calculated. The angle should have been measured would have been 34&ordm;, but was instead 26&ordm;. This can be attributed to ambient breeze, and the astrolabe not having single angle markers, but rather markers for every 10 degrees, so the angle cannot be measured precisely. The Goldman Sachs Building may also be at a different elevation than the point at which the angle was measured, which will have an impact on the angle.</span></p>
                        <p
                            class="c3 c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Statue of Liberty is 93 meters tall, versus the 181 meters that was calculated. This can be attributed to the Statue of Liberty being 2.59 kilometers away, and the fact that due to that a determinable angle was difficult to reach. The Statue of Liberty may also be at a different elevation to the point at which it was measured, and at that distance the curvature of the Earth may play a role in changing the outcome of the calculation.</span></p>
                            <p
                                class="c3 c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A determinable height for the Colgate Clock could not be found, however it is estimated that it is roughly 30 meters tall, and so the calculation is not that far off. A precise angle for the Colgate Clock was difficult to find as well, due to high amounts of wind in the area that it was measured. The Colgate Clock may be at a slightly different elevation to the area in which it was measured, which would influence the outcome.</span></p>
                                <p
                                    class="c3 c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 World Trade Center (WTC) is 541.3 meters tall, versus the 580 meters that was calculated. This is actually quite precise, as 1 WTC is the second farthest building on the list, at 1.9 kilometers from the measuring point. Manhattan may be on a different elevation than the measuring point, contributing to the inaccuracy of the number, and the astrolabe does not have single-angle markers, meaning the angle cannot be measured accurately.</span></p>
                                    <p
                                        class="c3 c7"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A determinable height for the New Jersey Central Railroad Terminal could not be found, however it is estimated that is is roughly 50 meters tall, making it the most precise measurement on the list. Any slight difference can be attributed to a slightly different elevation, and a precise angle not being measurable due to not having single-angle markers. The precision can also be attributable to the close proximity of the structure in question.</span></p>
