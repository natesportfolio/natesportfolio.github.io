        For 3 years, I've been participating in an extracurricular art class at my school, where I've worked on a multitude of different projects.

        This is the first of a series of building projects, where I create buildings out of old boxes and cover them in some sort of material, such as paper. This building has a modern feel, and includes a heliport and balcony.

    <img src="img/artextracurricular/PoolFocus.jpg" class="overlay-image" />
    <p>
        The second in the series, this one was more of an abstract building, although it included a pool on the roof and a park in the middle.

        This is what I call a "3D Painting", where I paint a normal painting, and then add clay in some places to give it a sense of depth.
