        This portfolio represents an amalgamation of the work that I've done and the activites that I've participated in during the past 3 years that I feel most proud of. I've chosen to handcraft a website from the ground up to demonstrate these passions, hobbies and fascinations because I feel that it accurately paints a picture of the level of detail, time and effort that I enjoy sinking into projects, but also the marriage of art and technology that I believe will be necessary for people of the future and that I believe I exhibit in the large majority of my projects. For the convenience of anyone who wishes to view my portfolio at their leisure, I've coded it so that the website will be usable on smaller devices with smaller screens as well.
